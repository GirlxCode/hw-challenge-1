## Description

This is the first H.W challenge assigned. I was tasked with making a website more ascessible for the client. The client gave, very specific instructions on how to do that such as making the index.html smeanticly organized. I was also tasked with adding alt elements into the code as well. The page was checked to make sure all links worked. The css was also consoliadted and organized to match the html page.
